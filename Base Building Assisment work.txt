1.The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that enables communication and the exchange of information between devices and users around the world.

2.A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and view web pages and other content on the internet. Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.

3.A browser engine is the core software component of a web browser that renders web pages and executes scripts. Examples of browser engines include Blink (used in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers), Gecko (used in Mozilla Firefox), and WebKit (used in Apple's Safari).

4.A static site is a website that is made up of fixed web pages that do not change unless manually updated. These sites are typically made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are served directly to the user's web browser when requested.

5.A dynamic site, on the other hand, is a website that is generated by a web application or content management system (CMS) in response to user requests. Dynamic sites typically have a database back-end and use server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby to generate content on the fly. Examples of dynamic sites include social media platforms, e-commerce websites, and news portals.
