    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        HTML entities are special codes or character references used in HTML to represent characters that have special meaning <br> or cannot be easily typed directly on a keyboard. They are represented by an ampersand (&) followed by a specific code or name,<br> and ending with a semicolon (;).</p>
        <h3>Here are five commonly used HTML entities:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li> &lt;- Represents the less-than symbol (<).</li>
        <li> &gt; - Represents the greater-than symbol (>).</li>
        <li>&amp; - Represents the ampersand symbol (&).</li>
        <li>&quot; - Represents the double quotation mark (").</li>
        <li>&copy; - Represents the copyright symbol (Â©).</li></ol>
        <p>These HTML entities allow you to include special characters in your HTML document without causing conflicts with the HTML syntax.</p>
