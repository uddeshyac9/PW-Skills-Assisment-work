    <h1>Here are three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML:</h1>
    <ol>
    <li>Use proper semantic structure: Use semantic HTML elements (such as header, nav, main, footer, etc.) to give meaning and structure to your content.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Provide alternative text for images: Use the alt attribute to describe the purpose or content of an image for users who cannot see it. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the image.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Use meaningful and descriptive link text: Ensure that link text provides clear and concise information about the destination. Avoid using generic phrases like "click here" or "read more."</li>
    </ol>
