What is the difference between UI and UX?
UI (User Interface) refers to the design of the visual elements and layout of a product, such as a website or application. UX (User Experience) refers to the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product. While UI is focused on the visual and interactive design, UX is focused on the entire experience, including ease of use, accessibility, and user satisfaction. In simpler terms, UI is how a product looks, while UX is how it feels.
